- **Operations:** Monitoring, alerting, disaster recovery

**Timeline:** Minimum 4-6 weeks of intensive development and testing required before production deployment can be considered.

**Risk Assessment:** 
- **Current Risk Level:** CRITICAL - System would fail catastrophically in production

## Conclusion

The Aura platform, while architecturally sound in concept, contains fundamental vulnerabilities that make it unsuitable for production deployment in its current state. The zero-day audit has revealed critical weaknesses in resource management, error handling, and resilience patterns that would cause complete system failure under real-world conditions.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Implement all critical and high-priority remediations before considering production deployment. The system requires significant hardening to meet enterprise-grade reliability standards.

**NEXT STEPS:** 
1. Implement immediate critical fixes
2. Conduct comprehensive testing of all failure scenarios
3. Perform additional security and performance testing
4. Re-audit system after remediation completion

This audit represents a comprehensive red team analysis designed to identify the most critical vulnerabilities that could impact production operations. The findings should be treated as a roadmap for hardening the system to enterprise standards.
